        <p>Happy Valentine's Baby. So yes this was the surprise I been telling you about. Nothing too special, ik. Not too creative on my end either since I made a website already to ask you out for valentines but I hope you like it anyways‚ù§Ô∏è </p> <br>
            
        <p>I love you, I love you so so so much, bhavya biyani. Really wish I could spend this day with you in-person. But alas it is what it is. I know Valentine's isn't really your thing and we can't go on a date irl but I wish I can make the day a bit more special for you than just any other day. You know it's just so nice to spend time with you every time. Even when we just fight most of the time or even when I'm sleep deprived asf and you're eating my head at 5 in the morning, especially then. </p> <br>

        <p>I just wanna be with you, hug you, kiss you, cuddle with you, go on cute lil walks with you, dates with you, car rides with you, and just spend time with you. I wanna lie beside you, wanna play with your hair, smell them and run my hand through them. Anyways enough being cheesy, I just wanted to showcase the amazing time I've had with you and the wonderful memories we've shared :)</p>

        <p>Happy Valentine's Day‚ù§Ô∏è. Here's to hoping we have many more valentines to come, especially some irl ones soon.ü•Ç </p>
